						             ---------------Health Tracker----------------



I developed code for Health tracker as per the requirments. 
Flow of the program is as follows:
   1. I have taken the input from the user for Name, Age, Sex, Weight,Height for the regisration.
   2. Based on the height and weight of the user we calculate BMI.
   3. I have converted the Steps to KM and hour to minutes in order to find the fastest speed, longest distance, shortest distance, slowest speed
   4. Finally the output is displayed a per the requirements.  


Thank you!
